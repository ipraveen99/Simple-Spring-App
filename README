This is a base application which uses spring multi action controller. I think it is hard to get a working multi action controller project online.This is developed by getting details from many websites.

This application does nothing but will keep 2 types of users admin and guest. Admin can list/add/edit/delete users and guest can do nothing.

Programs needed to download / set up

    JDK 1.5 or higher(1.7 is preferred)
    MySQL Community server (Database), MySql workbench latest versions
    JBoss 4.2.2 GA (higher versions can be used, if the configurations are updated correctly)
    Intellij IDEA 11.1 Community Edition (Eclipse can also be used, I don't prefer Netbeans)
    Git (with out this also it will work fine, as Intellij & Eclipse support checkout from the IDE itself) 

Steps for testing the Application

    Install all the above
    Download the war file from the dist directory
    create a user localuser in mysql (with password as localuser)
    restore the db file from the code
    assign desired permission to the localuser for the new schema
    Put the war file in jboss/server/default/deploy directory
    Start the JBoss server from jboss/run.bat
    In http://localhost:8080/mysimplespringapp/ our application will be up and running.
    Either create a database user name as username and password as password, or edit the same in MySimpleSpingApp/WebContent/WEB-INF/applicationCotext.xml
    In Mysql work bench insert a restore script which is available in MySimpleSpringApp/WebContent/WEB-INF/databaseDesign/databaseScripts.sql 

Now everything will work as expected.
Future chages

The changes we plan are:

    Hibernate
    Add Unit test - junit 3
    Create mock classes to support unit test
    Ability to read data from a property file
    Mock the db , and should be able to be live on mock mode
    Need to have 2 separate major versions of app which runs junit 3 and junit 4.
    Internationalization of pages (web pages)
    Build any big project out of this code base
